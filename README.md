Redesign of GetApp Landing Page


__Description:__

This project involves redesigning a specific frame of a landing page (Frame 2) originally created by GetApp. Using HTML and CSS, I replicated the design found in the provided Figma link, aiming to create a visually appealing and functional web page.


__Usage:__

To view the redesigned landing page, simply open the index.html file in any web browser. The page layout and design mirror the original design provided by GetApp in the Figma link (https://www.figma.com/file/Evk73rgFQfmBK22zEgOitI/Landings-UI%2FUX-examples-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=kDrRYLl5GlV56FOt-0)


_Note:_
This is a beginner-level project aimed at practicing HTML and CSS skills by replicating an existing design. No additional functionalities or interactivity beyond static design were implemented.
